# a-better-me
This is my personal repo to store, organize, and keep track of new technologies, languages, and learning projects for myself. Hopefully with this repo I can come back to it at the end of the year to see my progress and keep myself grounded. Hopefully I can see my personal growth to keep myself from doubting my progress and hard work that we tend to forget on a daily basis.
